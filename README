episode 9: creating basic HTTP server
run "node_modules/spikes/node_http/run.bat" to start the server
then go to localhost:8080 to hit the server.

episode 10: test-driving HTTP server
Exports in node are how you expose functionality between modules.
If you do a "require" to get a module from another file, like
var server = require("./server.js"),
then you can do server.<exportName>() to call the function declared
as exports.<exportName> in the server.js file.
Still need to figure out how to get the test not to hang when the server code
creates a new http server and sits there waiting for a response.

episode 11: lots of learning

to build:
