# Launching browsers

## Predefined browsers
- Chrome
- ChromeCanary
- Safari
- Firefox
- Opera
- IE8
- IE9
- IE10

Testacular always check env variable, eg. `CHROME_BIN` and if defined it uses it to start the browser. If not defined it falls back to a default value for given platform. See `launcher.js` for the default values.

Example config file:
browsers = ['Chrome', 'Firefox'];

CLI:
testacular start --browsers Chrome,Safari

### Custom profiles and settings
This will start the browser with an empty profile (Chrome, Firefox) and some other settings suitable for testing (eg. do not check default browser etc).

## Custom script

In addition to these default browsers, you can point to a custom script:

In config file:
browsers = ['/usr/local/bin/my-custom-browser'];

From CLI:
testacular start --browsers /usr/local/bin/my-custom-browser

The script will be called with one argument, which is the url to open.

Note, that if your script starts a child process (eg. you have a shell script that eventually trigger chrome binary), you need to explicitly kill the process when your script is killed.
